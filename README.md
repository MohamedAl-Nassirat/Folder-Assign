# Folder Assign 

Folder assign is an automated sorting system meant to prepare your machine learning training sets and sort them accordingly. 
In this specific script you will get the option of assigning the percentage amount of files you want to be split. Files will be safely split into a selection of Training and Validation folders, and ensures the corresponding annotations don't get lost in the splitting.

## How it works
  1. Load your .png and .txt files into the main img folder
  2. CD into directory saved and run  `python3 folderassign.py` in terminal
  3. Files will be sorted at random into Training and Validation according to your percentages and the sets and can be easily accessed in `imgTraining` `imgValidation` `labelValidation` `labelTraining`
  
## To-Do
  1. Accept all data types (.xml, .csv, .jpeg etc)
